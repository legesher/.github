# Background

Computer programming, as a global discipline, is predominantly English-based. However, only 4% of people in the world are native English speakers. Non-Native English Speakers (NNES) lack the support and resources to thrive mastering code in a foreign language.Legesher creates access for the other 96% of the world to code in the context of their native language. 

# Introduction

**`Legesher`** is an open source collection of native-language based developer tools and resources designed for education, innovation, and collaboration. 

> Because innovation, creativity, and collaboration shouldn't be lost in translation

**Legesher's** products enable anyone to code in their native language. We built **Legesher** on top of [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), an open source text editor, and [Git w/ GitHub](https://github.com), a version control tool, in order to give users as much of a personal invitation to programming as we could.

# Legesher Projects

Legesher Developer Tools might be useful to you if:

- you are a non-native english speaker
- you are new to programming
- you work on a team with non-native english speakers
- you are a developer (simple enough)
